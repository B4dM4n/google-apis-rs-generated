## Development

To easily alter MCP code without having to commit, run `make` with an overridden `MCP` environment variable, pointing
to one that you just build. Typical invocations would look like this:

```
(cd ../generator && cargo build) && MCP=../generator/target/debug/mcp make -f Makefile.generated
```
