[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google-apis-rs/generated.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google-apis-rs/generated)

A repository to contain all files generated by tools with the [APIs repository][gen-repo].

[gen-repo](https://github.com/google-apis-rs/apis)

## Development

### Using a custom MCP executable

To easily alter MCP code without having to commit, run `just` with an overridden `MCP` argument, pointing
to one that you just build. Typical invocations would look like this:

```
(cd ../generator && cargo build) && just MCP=$PWD/../generator/target/debug/mcp update-drivers
```

### Forcefully regenerating/rebuilding crates even if they errorred before

The system will remember generator and cargo errors, and not attempt to work on the affected APIs again, unless these files are cleared.
This can be done manually, or by force.

```
just refresh-with-force
```

From there you would usually go with the following to gather all error data with refreshed code:
```
just update-mcp
make -C gen gen-all -kj8
just update-drivers
make -C gen cargo-all ARGS=check  -k
just update-drivers
```

### Forcefully update the Makefile after a change affecting the mapped index

```
(cd ../generator && cargo build) && just MCP=$PWD/../generator/target/debug/mcp update-drivers
```
